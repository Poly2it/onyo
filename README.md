# onyo ðŸ§…

onyo ðŸ§… is an interpreted programming language.

```lisp
(defun (fact n) (
    (if (! (> n 1)) (
        (return 1)
    ) else (
        (return (* n (fact (- n 1))))
    ))
))

(defun (main) (
    (print (fact 5))
))
```

onyo uses reference counting to automatically manage memory. onyo is dynamically typed. onyo uses a lisp-like syntax. The optional pre-compiler (Written in python) provides a "sane" alternative syntax.
